**Updates**

* Documentation running on Jekyll 3.0.2 for github pages.
* Updated documentation using Markdown
* Updated homepage
* Removed custom fonts from documentation
* Added search to documentation
* Added `button-icon` classes for `<button>` and `.button` to allow for easy SVG icons
* Using `rem` units for sizing across the board for easier responsive sizing using `@root-font-size`
* Added flexbox utiltiy classes
* Added `.uppercase(@letter-spacing)` mixin that takes `@letter-spacing` to customise of uppercase text
* Added styles for the `<mark>` element

**Breaking Chnages**

* Simplified `<table>` styling, breaking change to responsive tables
* Added styles for `<input>` on `:hover`
* Removed input group size classes, rather rely on the sizing of buttons and inputs independently
* Removed `@base-font-size` variables in favour of `@root-font-size` being applied to the document `:root`. Works the same way as before with xlarge, large, medium, small and xsmall breakpoints

**Fixes**

* `gutter-bottom` and `gutter-top` classes multiply `@gutter` by 2 to maintain same distance between elements as side gutters
* Paragraphs within the `<blockquote>` inherit styling to allow for the use of `<blockquote>` without a `<p>` tag within
* `@list-item-line-height` added using paragraph line-height as default
* Removed borders on buttons as default
* Added `@table-margin` for `<table>`using paragraph margin as default
